    <h1>Understanding CSS Display Property</h1>

    <div class="container">
        <h2>Block Display</h2>
        <p>A block element always starts on a **new line** and takes up the **full width** available. <span class="block-example">This is a block-level element.</span>  Examples include div, p, and h1.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
        <h2>Inline Display</h2>
        <p>An inline element **does not** start on a new line and only takes up as much width as necessary. <span class="inline-example">This is an inline element.</span>  You **cannot** set its width or height. Examples include span, a, and strong.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
        <h2>Inline-Block Display</h2>
        <p>An inline-block element is similar to an inline element, but you **can** set its width and height. <span class="inline-block-example">This is an inline-block element.</span>  It flows with the surrounding text but can be styled with dimensions.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="container">
        <h2>None Display</h2>
        <p>The `display: none;` property **hides** an element completely from the page. It's not just invisible; it is removed from the document flow as if it never existed. The space it would have occupied is also gone. <span class="none-example">This element is hidden.</span>  The element is not rendered, and it doesn't take up any space.</p>
    </div>
