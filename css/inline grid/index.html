    <p>This is a paragraph of text that comes before the inline grid container. Notice how the grid container sits on the same line as this text, rather than starting on a new line. This is the key difference between <code>display: grid</code> and <code>display: inline-grid</code>.</p>

    <div class="inline-grid-container">
        <div class="grid-item">A</div>
        <div class="grid-item">B</div>
        <div class="grid-item">C</div>
        <div class="grid-item">D</div>
    </div>

    <p>This is a paragraph of text that comes after the inline grid container. The text continues on the same line as the container, demonstrating its inline behavior. The container only takes up the space it needs, allowing other elements to flow around it.</p>
