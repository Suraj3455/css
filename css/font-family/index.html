        <h1>A Classic Serif Heading</h1>
        <p class="body-text">This paragraph uses a clean, readable sans-serif font stack. Sans-serif fonts are excellent for large blocks of text on digital screens due to their simplicity and legibility.</p>

        <p class="monospace-text">This is monospace font. It's often used for code snippets, financial data, or anything that requires a uniform character width.</p>
        
        <p class="cursive-text">This paragraph showcases a decorative cursive font. These are great for adding a personal or informal touch, but should be used sparingly for headings or short phrases, as they can be difficult to read in large quantities.</p>
        
        <p class="fantasy-text">Here is an example of a fantasy font. Like cursive fonts, these are highly stylized and best reserved for titles or specific design elements.</p>
